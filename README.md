IT's LIVE: https://pauz-clothing.herokuapp.com/

This was a huge project and accomplishment for me. I'm typing this at 7:35am, I have not slept.... I am exhausted. I do not where I made the error, but the app was running fine on localHost:3000, then failed in deploy to Heroku. I figured it out though!! The deploy went through after I checked dependencies and re-installed firebase, then updated the firebase db info and did the same with Stripe for the checkouts, then as if by magic. Its now live. And it even looks like it is working as intended! Im super stoked. 

This is a React app, started with create-react-app, it has firebase integrated for auth, and backend Shop data to be built out on that platform. Stripe for payment Auth. You can log in with your Google Acct And COMPONENTS so many components.

TL, DR:

E-Commerce site built on React -Redux, utilizing Firebase for DB & Auth, Stripe for payments, Stylized Components and its live on Heroku.
